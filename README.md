This is a exploratory repository where I dive into new topics to broaden my knowledge, focusing on learning and documenting key concepts. The repository is a space where I explore foundational tools for the time being it has HTML and CSS, taking detailed notes on what I learn along the way. Itâ€™s designed as a resource for both personal growth and to share insights with others, containing code snippets, examples, of these technologies. This journey of exploration allows me to build a strong foundation while keeping track of my progress in an organized manner.
